# 📚 ScratchSeq

**ScratchSeq** is a from-scratch learning project for **sequence modeling and language understanding**, implemented with a **PyTorch-first mindset**.  
The goal is not benchmark performance, but **mechanistic understanding** — how sequence models evolved, why each innovation mattered, and how to implement them cleanly.

---

## 🎯 Philosophy

- Implement **core models** before using abstractions
- Read **original papers alongside code**
- Prefer **minimal, inspectable implementations**
- Focus on **learning signals, gradients, and inductive biases**

This repository is designed as a **learning timeline**, not a model zoo.

## 🔍 Non-Goals

- ❌ No large-scale pretraining
- ❌ No SOTA chasing
- ❌ No heavy frameworks or wrappers
- ❌ No “black box” usage

---

## 📌 Outcome

By completing ScratchSeq, one should be able to:

- Derive sequence models from first principles
- Understand why transformers replaced recurrence
- Reason about attention, memory, and scaling limits
- Read modern LLM papers without hand-waving gaps

---

## 🧱 Status

🚧 Work in progress — built incrementally alongside paper reading and experimentation.

---

**ScratchSeq** is about *earning intuition*, not importing it.
